# Electron-webpack

This repo is a base project which facilitates the start of development of an electron app with webpack.

## Quick start

Just edit the files in `src` and run in terminal:

```sh
npm start
```

It will create the `main.js` file for the main Electron process, start the `webpack-dev-server` and start the Electron app using the `main.js` file.

## Todo

* [ ] Add base Angular 2 project and config.
* [ ] Add HMR for Angular 2.
